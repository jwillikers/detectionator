A Raspberry Pi camera for taking pictures using object detection.

== Overview

The Detectionator is a fairly minimal Raspberry Pi camera build for taking pictures of particular objects like animals or people.
The Detectionator incorporates {Exif} geolocation metadata in the photographs it takes.
With the help of my {AutoUpload} project, pictures are automatically offloaded from the local storage to cloud-based storage such as S3-compatible object storage with {Rclone} or to {Immich} with the {Immich-CLI}.
The photos are then removed from local storage.
This repository contains documentation, configuration files, and the Python program for the Detectionator.
The project is largely based off of the tensorflow example in the {picamera2} project and includes the same models.

== Components

The Detectionator is based off of the Raspberry Pi 5 and the Camera Module 3.
It incorporates a GPS to obtain the geolocation data to embed in the photographs.

* A sufficiently large and performant microSD card.
The https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/pro-ultimate-adapter-microsdxc-128gb-mb-my128sa-am/[128GB Samsung Pro Ultimate] and https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/pro-endurance-adapter-microsdxc-128gb-mb-mj128ka-am/[128GB Samsung Pro Endurance] are two good options.
* A USB-C to USB-A cable to connect the Adafruit Ultimate GPS with USB to the Pi.
* A USB-C power supply for powering the Pi.
* A fan or case with a fan to keep the Raspberry Pi 5 cool.

== Install

. Install the 64-bit full version of https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi OS] to a microSD card.
The configuration files assume the primary user is `core`, which can be configured when using Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image.
This project has been tested with Raspberry Pi OS 5 based on Debian Bookworm.
. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.
. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
. Follow the instructions to configure the storage service and autoupload {systemd} units in the {AutoUpload} README.
This will automatically upload photos in the `~/Pictures` directory.
The commands to enable the units should look similar to the following.
These use the _system_ units, though _user_ units work just as well.
+
Immich::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-immich@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

Rclone::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-rclone@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

. For security, be sure to disable password-based SSH authentication.
After your public key has been added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Pi Camera, this can be configured in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.
You can follow the instructions in my https://github.com/jwillikers/openssh-config[OpenSSH Config] repository to accomplish this and a few other optimizations.

. Update the package lists.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get update
----

. Upgrade everything.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get --yes full-upgrade
----

. Install {just} by following the instructions in the https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[installation section].

. Make the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/Projects
----

. Clone this project's repository to the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone https://github.com/jwillikers/detectionator.git
----

. Change to the project's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/detectionator
----

. Set up the environment with `just init`.
This will install dependencies and initialize the virtual environment.
It also installs a special udev rule for the Adafruit Ultimate GPS to give it a static device name.
+
[,sh]
----
just install
----

. Reboot for the new udev rules to take effect.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Use `just run` to run the `detectionator.py` Python script inside the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
just run
----

. Install and activate the systemd service with `just install`.
+
[,sh]
----
just install
----

== HDR

The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 supports HDR, but only at a lower resolution.
HDR support has to toggled when `detectionator.py` isn't running and requires passing a special flag to `detectionator.py`.

. Show the available V4L subdevices.
+
[,sh]
----
ls /dev/v4l-subdev*
/dev/v4l-subdev0  /dev/v4l-subdev1  /dev/v4l-subdev2  /dev/v4l-subdev3
----

. To enable HDR support for the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, use the following command on one of the V4L subdevices.
In my case, this ended up being `/dev/v4l-subdev2`.
+
[,sh]
----
just hdr /dev/v4l-subdev2
----

. To disable HDR support for the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, use this command with the corresponding V4L subdevice.
+
[,sh]
----
just hdr /dev/v4l-subdev2 false
----

== Development

. Run `just init-dev` to initialize the virtual environment for development.
This will install all of the necessary dependencies and the {pre-commit} hooks.
+
[,sh]
----
just init-dev
----

. Run the tests with https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/[pytest] by running `just test`.
+
[,sh]
----
just test
----

. To update dependencies, run `just update`.
+
[,sh]
----
just update
----

. Use `just --list` to list other available tasks.
+
[,sh]
----
just --list
----
