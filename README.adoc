A Raspberry Pi camera for taking pictures using object detection.

== Overview

The Detectionator is a fairly minimal Raspberry Pi camera build for taking pictures of particular objects like animals or people.
The Detectionator incorporates {Exif} geolocation metadata in the photographs it takes.
With the help of my {AutoUpload} project, pictures are automatically offloaded from the local storage to cloud-based storage such as S3-compatible object storage with {Rclone} or to {Immich} with the {Immich-CLI}.
The photos are then removed from local storage.
This repository contains documentation, configuration files, and the Python program for the Detectionator.
The project is largely based off of the tensorflow example in the {picamera2} project and includes the same models.

== Components

The Detectionator is based off of the Raspberry Pi 5 and the Camera Module 3.
It incorporates a GPS to obtain the geolocation data to embed in the photographs.

* A USB-C to USB-A cable to connect the Adafruit Ultimate GPS with USB to the Pi.
* A USB-C power supply for powering the Pi.
* A fan or case with a fan to keep the Raspberry Pi 5 cool.

== Install

. Install the 64-bit full version of https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi OS] to a microSD card.
The configuration files assume the primary user is `core`, which can be configured when using Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image.
This project has been tested with Raspberry Pi OS 5 based on Debian Bookworm.
. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.
. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
. Follow the instructions to configure the storage service and autoupload systemd units in the {AutoUpload} README.
This will automatically upload photos in the `~/Pictures` directory.
The commands to enable the units should look similar to the following.
These use the _system_ units, though _user_ units work just as well.
+
Immich::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-immich@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

Rclone::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-rclone@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

. For security, be sure to disable password-based SSH authentication.
After your public key has been added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Pi Camera, this can be configured in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.
You can follow the instructions in my https://github.com/jwillikers/openssh-config[OpenSSH Config] repository to accomplish this and a few other optimizations.

. Update the package lists.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get update
----

. Upgrade everything.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get --yes full-upgrade
----

. Install the necessary and unnecessary packages.
I like fish, tmux, and vim, what can I say?
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get --yes install build-essential firewalld fish git libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python3-picamera2 python3-venv tmux vim
----

. Make the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/Projects
----

. Clone this project's repository to the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone https://github.com/jwillikers/detectionator.git
----

. Change to the project's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/detectionator
----

. Install the udev rules to create a static symlink for the serial device of the Adafruit Ultimate GPS.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo cp etc/udev/rules.d/99-adafruit-ultimate-gps-usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-adafruit-ultimate-gps-usb.rules
----

. Connect the Adafruit Ultimate GPS to the Raspberry Pi.

. Create a virtual environment for the project.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
----

. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
source venv/bin/activate.fish
----

. Install the dependencies in the venv.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
----

. Test the `detection.py` script.
+
[,sh]
----
python detectionator.py \
    --model models/mobilenet_v2.tflite \
    --label models/coco_labels.txt \
    --output ~/Pictures
----

. Exit the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
exit
----

. Create the systemd directory for user units.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/.config/systemd/user
----

. Symlink the systemd unit to the `~/.config/systemd/user/` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
ln --force --relative --symbolic systemd/user/* ~/.config/systemd/user/
----

. Enable and start the `detectionator.service` systemd unit.
+
[,sh]
----
systemctl --user enable --now detectionator.service
----

== Development

It's recommended to use the provided {pre-commit} checks when developing.

. Create a virtual environment if you haven't done so already.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
----

. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
source venv/bin/activate.fish
----

. Install the development packages.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
----

. Install the packages.
This project uses pip-tools to synchronize virtual environments for development.
Sync your virtual environments packages with those pinned in the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files with the `pip-sync` command.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-sync requirements-dev.txt requirements.txt
----

. Install the Git hooks for pre-commit.
+
[,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. Run the tests with https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/[pytest].
+
[,sh]
----
pytest
----

. Upgrade the packages pinned in the `requirements.txt` file with the `pip-compile` command.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-compile \
  --allow-unsafe \
  --generate-hashes \
  --reuse-hashes \
  --upgrade \
  requirements.in
----

. The pinned development packages in the `requirements-dev.txt` file can be upgraded in the same fashion.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-compile \
  --allow-unsafe \
  --generate-hashes \
  --reuse-hashes \
  --upgrade \
  requirements-dev.in
----
